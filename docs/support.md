## The Google HTTP Client Library for Java Community

### Ask development questions

Ask  questions on StackOverflow:

* Use the [google-api][so-google-api] tag, and optionally [java][so-java] or [android][so-android]
  or [java google-app-engine][so-java-gae].
* You can also use the [google-http-java-client][so-http-client] tag.
* For tips on asking StackOverflow questions, see [How to Ask][so-how-to-ask].

**Note:** Please do not email the project contributors directly.

### File feature requests and defects

You can suggest features and report issues on our public [Issue Tracker][issues]. This is a great
place for the community to discuss and track implementations of features or resolution of bug fixes,
as well as share workarounds and patches.

If you find a bug:

* View [known bugs][issues], and if a known bug corresponds to the issue you are seeing, "star" it
  or comment on it.
* If the issue you are seeing has not yet been reported, [file a bug report][new-issue].

This is an [open-source][http-client] library, and [contributions][contributions] are welcome.
